What to Look For
Good Signs

Accuracy improving week-over-week
Higher confidence on correct predictions
Profit factor > 1.5
Consistent model agreement

Warning Signs

Accuracy below 50% for 2+ weeks

If accuracy is:

Below 50%: Check market conditions, may need retraining
50-55%: Normal for first 2 weeks
55-60%: Expected after 1 month
60-65%: Good performance
Above 65%: Excellent (verify it's real)
